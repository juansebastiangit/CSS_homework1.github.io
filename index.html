    <h2>Sourdough starter & Sourdough bread</h2>
    <p>
        Sourdough bread is a type of bread made using a natural fermentation process that
         relies on a sourdough starter instead of commercial yeast. A sourdough starter is 
         a live culture of flour and water that, over time, captures wild yeast and 
         beneficial bacteria from the environment. This natural fermentation gives sourdough 
         its distinct tangy flavor, chewy texture, and long shelf life. The process of making 
         sourdough bread is slower than traditional breadmaking, but the result is a highly 
         digestible and nutrient-rich loaf cherished for its artisanal quality and complex taste.
