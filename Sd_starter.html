    <h2>Sourdough starter?</h2>
    <p>
        A sourdough starter is a natural, living culture made by combining flour and water and allowing 
        it to ferment over time. This mixture acts as a natural leavening agent, replacing the need for 
        commercial yeast in breadmaking. The starter captures wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria (commonly Lactobacillus species)
        from the environment and the flour itself. These microorganisms feed on the carbohydrates in the flour, 
        producing carbon dioxide, which helps the bread rise, and lactic acid, which gives sourdough its characteristic tangy flavor.
        The creation of a starter typically takes about 5 to 7 days, during which regular feedings of fresh flour and water 
        are required to maintain the culture's vitality. The wild yeast in the starter thrives under these conditions,
        while the lactic acid bacteria create an acidic environment that preserves the starter and inhibits the growth 
        of harmful microorganisms.
        Once established, a sourdough starter can be kept alive indefinitely with proper care, making it a perpetual source 
        of natural leavening. It is a versatile and essential component for baking sourdough bread and can also be used in other
        baked goods like pancakes, waffles, and muffins. The unique flavor and characteristics of a starter vary depending
        on factors like the type of flour used, the water, and the local environment, making each sourdough starter truly one-of-a-kind.
